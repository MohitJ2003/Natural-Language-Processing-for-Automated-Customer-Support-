# RNN-NLP Customer Support (Flask) - Project Skeleton

This repository is a minimal skeleton for a Flask-based project that will implement
an RNN-based NLP system for automating customer support (sentiment analysis,
intent recognition, response generation). All code is intentionally simple/placeholder
so you can expand later.

## Structure
- app.py - Flask app (simple routes)
- requirements.txt - Python deps
- nlp/ - placeholder NLP modules (sentiment, intent, response generation)
- models/ - placeholder for trained models
- templates/ - Flask HTML templates
- static/ - static assets (CSS/JS)
- utils/ - helper utilities
- tests/ - basic test skeleton
- Dockerfile - optional containerization
